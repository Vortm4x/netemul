<h1>Ip-address</h1>
<p>Ip-address - the unique identifier (address) devices (usually the computer), connected to a local area network and (or) to the Internet.<br>
Ip-address represents 32-bit (under version IPv4) or 128-bit (under version IPv6) binary number. The convenient form of record of 
ip-address (IPv4) is record in the form of four decimal numbers (from 0 to 255), divided by points, for example, 192.168.0.1. 
(Or 128.10.2.30 — the traditional decimal form of representation of the address, and 10000000 00001010 00000010 00011110 — the binary 
form of representation the same address).<br>
Ip-addresses represent the main type of addresses on which basis IP protocol network layer transfers packages between networks. 
Ip-address is assigned by network manager during configuration of computers and routers.<br>
Ip-address consists of two parts: numbers of a network and site number. In case of the isolated network its address can be selected the 
network manager from blocks of addresses specially reserved for such networks (192.168.0.0/16 172.16.0.0/12 or 10.0.0.0/8).<br>
The host address in IP protocol is assigned irrespective of the address of the local interface. The router by definition 
enters at once into some networks.Therefore each port of a router has own ip-address. The computer host also can enter into 
some IP-networks. In this case the computer should have some ip-addresses, on number of network links. Thus, ip-address characterizes 
not the separate computer or a router, and one network connection.</p>
<p>In IP protocol there are some agreements on special interpretation of ip-addresses:
<ul><li>If all ip-address consists only of binary zero it designates the address of that site which has generated this package, 
this mode is used only in some messages ICMP;</li>
<li>If in the field of network number there are only zero by default it is considered that the assignment site belongs to the same network, 
as the site which has sent a package; this mode is used only in some messages ICMP;</li>
<li>If all bits of ip-address are equal 1 the package with such address of assignment should be dispatched to all sites which are in the 
same network, as a source of this package. Such dispatch is named as the limited broadcasting message (limited broadcast);</li>
<li>If in the field of number of the site of assignment there are only units the package having such address, is dispatched to all net 
points with set number of a network. For example, in a network 192.190.21.0 with a mask 255.255.255.0 package with 192.190.21.255 address 
is supplied to all sites of this network. Such dispatch is named as the broadcasting message (broadcast).</li></ul>
</p>
<h1>Network mask</h1>
<p>In terminology of networks TCP/IP the bit pattern defining is named as a mask of a subnet or a network mask, what part of ip-address 
of a net point concerns the network address, and what — to the address of the site in this network. For example, the site with ip-address 
12.34.56.78 and a mask of a subnet 255.255.255.0 is in a network 12.34.56.0/24.<br>
Other variant of definition is a definition of a subnet of ip-addresses. For example, by means of a subnet mask it is possible to tell that 
one range of ip-addresses will be in one subnet, and other range accordingly in other subnet.<br>
To receive the network address, knowing ip-address and a subnet mask, it is necessary to apply to them operation of digit-by-digit 
conjunction (logical). For example, in case of more difficult mask (bit operations in IPv6 look identically):</p>

<h1>Arp-protocol</h1>
<p>ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) — the network protocol of data link layer intended for conversion of ip-addresses (network layer) in 
MAC-addresses (data link layer) in networks TCP/IP.</p>
<p>ARP — very widespread and extremely important protocol. Each host has two addresses, the physical address and the logical address. 
In network Ethernet for identification of a source and the receiver of the information both addresses are used. 
The information transferred from one computer to another on a network comprises the physical address of the source and ip-address of the source,
the physical address of the receiver and ip-address of the receiver. The ARP-report provides link between these two addresses. 
There are four types of ARP-messages: ARP request, ARP reply, RARP request and the RARP reply. 
The local host by means of ARP requests the physical address of a host-receiver. The answer (the physical address of a host-receiver) 
comes in ARP-reply. The Host-receiver, together with the answer, sends also the RARP request addressed to the source to check up its ip-address. 
After check of ip-address of the source transmission of packages of the data starts. Records in ARP table can be static and dynamic.</p>
